# THIS IS A WIP
Nothing is functional and it's all experimental.
Nothing in this project is secure for real-world use until I'm done.

# OPEN TO ADVICE
Advice, tips, critics are all welcome!
I REALLY MEAN IT(I want to make sure at a minimum the encryption algorithms and how I use them are good)

# Overseer Data Vault
What I think should be a good data/password manager.

## Requirements
* [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
